To whoever finds this recording, I don't know if this thing is still working, I don't know if we share the same language, nor do I know if we share the same communicating method. If you are able to translate this.. or to understand this, I just want you to listen carefully as to what I'm about to say. To listen carefully to my silly yet sad story. To listen carefully... **to my last pieces of voice** I made with **my last breath**. I've left the other recordings in the back of the van. If you don't want to listen to what I'm about to say, at least please keep it. My last remnant, proof of my struggle in this mad world, proof of my incompetence and bad luck... **_proof that I was once alive_**.
